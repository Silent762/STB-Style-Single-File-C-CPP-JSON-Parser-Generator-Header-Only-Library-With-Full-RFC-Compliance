Why this project

In many projects you need a JSON parser and generator. Some teams tolerate heavier dependencies or bespoke formats. Others prefer a minimal footprint. This library aims to be practical and predictable. It follows the STB tradition: a single header that is easy to drop into any host project. It minimizes surface area without sacrificing capability.

The goals are straightforward:
- Provide a complete JSON toolchain in one header. The header contains the implementation and the API you need.
- Support not just parsing and generation but also JSON Pointer, JSON Patch, and Merge Patch per RFCs 6901, 6902, and 7386.
- Run without dependencies. No external libraries required to compile or run.
- Be thread-safe for typical use cases. No hidden global state in common scenarios.
- Validate and handle UTF-8 robustly. Misencoded data should be detectable and reportable.
- Be friendly to embedded systems. Small memory footprint, no dynamic linking, and options to hook memory management.
- Offer flexible I/O options. Read from or write to files, memory buffers, or custom streams.
- Expose a clean, well-documented API. Provide examples that show the simplest use and the more advanced flows.

Core goals

The library is designed with pragmatic goals in mind. You write code that is reliable, maintainable, and easy to port. The library lets you describe a JSON structure in memory, modify it with patches, and emit new JSON text. The API is intentionally lean. It avoids surprises. It is designed to be predictable in edge cases and well-behaved in low-resource environments.

Key features

- Single-header, header-only library
- RFC 8259 compliant JSON parsing and generation
- RFC 6901 JSON Pointer support
- RFC 6902 JSON Patch support
- RFC 7386 Merge Patch support
- Zero dependencies
- Thread-safe with clear usage guarantees
- UTF-8 validation and handling
- File I/O helpers
- JSON minification and pretty printing
- Custom allocators and memory hooks
- Cross-platform: works with C and C++ compilers on many platforms
- Embedded-friendly: small footprint, minimal runtime requirements
- Clear, minimal API surface with optional extensions

How it works

The library follows a straightforward design. A single header provides:
- A small, plain C API for parsing and emitting JSON.
- A compact internal representation of JSON values with types for null, boolean, number, string, array, and object.
- Functions to navigate and manipulate JSON using standard structures.
- Patch operations that modify a JSON document in place using JSON Patch and Merge Patch semantics.
- Pointer evaluation via JSON Pointer to traverse and access nodes by path.

The header can be included in any translation unit. To enable the implementation in a single TU, you typically define a symbol before inclusion (as with many STB-style libraries). This lets you compile either as a library consumer or as the library provider for a single translation unit. The interface is designed to be easy to learn for C programmers and friendly for C++ projects as well.

RFC compliance overview

- RFC 8259 JSON: The core grammar and encoding rules are implemented. Numbers, strings, booleans, null, arrays, and objects are parsed and emitted according to the standard. UTF-8 support ensures text is valid and well-formed.
- RFC 6901 JSON Pointer: You can access nested values using pointers. The library provides functions to resolve a path to a node or to validate pointer syntax.
- RFC 6902 JSON Patch: Patch documents describe edits to a target JSON document. The patch processor applies operations like add, remove, replace, move, copy, and test against a document, with safe fallbacks.
- RFC 7386 Merge Patch: Merge patches provide a simple way to update a document with a patch object. The library supports applying merge patches to a base document for straightforward updates.

Design decisions

- Minimal dependencies: The header contains all implementation. No other libraries are required to build or run.
- Safety-first defaults: UTF-8 validation is on by default. Users can enable or disable certain checks if needed for performance in trusted environments.
- Thread-safety by design: The typical usage pattern is to create separate JSON values per thread or per task. The library avoids global state that could cause races.
- Extensibility: The API is designed to add features without breaking existing code. Optional features can be enabled via compile-time macros.
- Portability: The code uses standard C constructs and careful allocator options to work across compilers and platforms.

API overview

The library exposes a lean API with a handful of core types and functions. Here is a high-level map:

- json_value: A discriminated union representing any JSON value. Types include null, boolean, number, string, array, and object.
- json_parse(input, length, out_value): Parse JSON from a string buffer. Returns a status code and fills out_value with the parsed document.
- json_emit(value, output, max_len): Emit a JSON document into a user-provided buffer. Returns the number of characters written or an error.
- json_pointer(value, path, out_value): Resolve a JSON Pointer path to a value within a document.
- json_patch(base, patch, out_value): Apply a JSON Patch to a base document to produce a patched document.
- json_merge_patch(base, patch, out_value): Apply a Merge Patch to base using patch, producing a new document.
- json_minify(input, length, output, max_len): Minify a JSON document by removing whitespace not required by the grammar.
- json_validate_utf8(input, length): Validate that the input is valid UTF-8.

The actual API surface in the header is minimal. It keeps the public surface small while offering the functionality you need for real-world tasks.

Usage examples

Basic parse and emit

- You read a JSON string, parse it into a value, and then emit it back as a string.

Example (conceptual):

#include "stb_json.h" // adjust include path as needed

const char* json_text = "{\"name\":\"Ada\",\"age\":30,\"active\":true}";
json_value root;
if (json_parse(json_text, strlen(json_text), &root) == JSON_OK) {
  // Work with root...
  char out[256];
  size_t written = json_emit(&root, out, sizeof(out));
  // Use the emitted string
  json_free_value(&root);
}

Patch and merge patch

- You can modify a document using a JSON Patch or a Merge Patch. Patches describe the edits; the library applies them and returns a new document.

Example (conceptual):

// Base document
const char* base_json = "{\"name\":\"Ada\",\"age\":30}";
json_value base;
json_parse(base_json, strlen(base_json), &base);

// Patch
const char* patch_json = "[{\"op\":\"replace\",\"path\":\"/age\",\"value\":31}]";
json_value patch;
json_parse(patch_json, strlen(patch_json), &patch);

json_value patched;
json_patch(&base, &patch, &patched);

json_free_value(&base);
json_free_value(&patched);

JSON Pointer

- Access nested values using a pointer path.

Example (conceptual):

const char* path = "/address/street";
json_value street;
json_pointer(&root, path, &street);
printf("Street: %s\n", json_string_value(&street));

Minification and I/O

- The library provides a minify function to compress JSON. It also offers file I/O helpers that bridge parsing and emission with real files.

Example (conceptual):

FILE* f = fopen("config.json", "r");
fseek(f, 0, SEEK_END);
size_t len = ftell(f);
fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET);
char* buf = (char*)malloc(len);
fread(buf, 1, len, f);
fclose(f);

json_value v;
if (json_parse(buf, len, &v) == JSON_OK) {
  char out[1024];
  json_emit(&v, out, sizeof(out));
  // Save or display the emitted JSON
}
free(buf);
json_free_value(&v);

Custom allocators and memory hooks

- The header supports plugging in custom memory management. You can supply your own alloc and free functions, or wire in a pool allocator, stack allocator, or a small region allocator suitable for your platform.

Example (conceptual):

typedef void* (*my_alloc)(size_t);
typedef void  (*my_free)(void*);

my_alloc alloc = your_alloc_function;
my_free  free  = your_free_function;

json_set_memory_hooks(alloc, free);

Thread safety and concurrency

- The design aims to be thread-safe for typical usage. The library avoids global mutable state. Each thread should create and operate on its own JSON values. If you use shared data structures, guard access with your own synchronization primitives.

- For multithreaded work that touches the same document, consider you need an external synchronization layer. The header does not impose a global lock strategy because it would hurt performance and complicate usage for many embedded projects.

Cross-platform considerations

- The library targets Windows, Linux, macOS, and common embedded toolchains. It should compile cleanly with modern compilers such as GCC, Clang, Cl, and MSVC.

- Endianness and numeric parsing are handled predictably. Numbers are parsed in line with the RFCs and converted to native types in your environment.

- File I/O helpers are designed to be portable. They wrap standard library calls or provide a minimal abstraction that can be swapped out in restricted environments.

- UTF-8 handling is robust across platforms. The validation checks are careful to catch invalid sequences and produce meaningful error feedback.

Build and integration

- This is a header-only library. The normal approach is to include the header in a single translation unit and declare the implementation there if required by your build.

- Typical usage pattern:
  - Place the header file in your include path.
  - Before including the header in one TU, define a macro that enables the implementation if you want to build the executable from a single TU.
  - Optionally define STB_JSON_ENABLE_ALLOC or other macros to customize behavior.

- Build with C or C++. The headerâ€™s API is designed to feel natural in both languages. When used in C++, you can lean on standard library facilities, but you can also interact in a C-like fashion if you prefer.

- Quick-start for CMake projects:
  - Add the header to your include directory.
  - If you want to wrap the code in a module, you can create a small CMake target that compiles an executable or a test.

- For embedded projects, you can embed the header directly in your project tree. This keeps your build self-contained and minimizes the risk of symbol conflicts or library drift.

- If you rely on static analysis or strict compiler flags, you may want to turn on a few warnings or adopt stricter ISO C settings. The code is written to be clean and readable, with well-scoped declarations and clear types.

Testing and quality

- The repository includes unit tests and integration tests that exercise parsing, emission, and the RFC-specific flows. Tests cover:
  - Basic JSON documents
  - Nested objects and arrays
  - Unicode strings and escaped characters
  - Complex patches and patches that move values
  - Merge patches across nested structures
  - Pointer evaluation along various paths
  - Minification across different input styles
  - Memory allocator hooks
  - Threaded usage patterns

- Tests are important to ensure RFC conformance and to help prevent regressions as the header evolves.

- You can run tests locally to verify behavior on your platform. The tests are designed to be deterministic and quick to run in a CI environment.

Examples and recipes

- Basic workflow
  - Parse a JSON string
  - Validate UTF-8 integrity
  - Access values via pointers
  - Patch the document
  - Emit the result to a string or a file

- Patch workflows
  - JSON Patch is ideal for a sequence of updates. It represents changes as operations. You can apply patches to a document to reach a new state.  
  - Merge Patch is more compact for straightforward updates. It lets you specify only the fields that should be replaced or removed.

- Pointer workflows
  - JSON Pointer provides precise navigation. You can use path strings to fetch nested values and to validate the existence of nodes.

- Minification workflows
  - Minification reduces the amount of data transmitted or stored. It preserves the semantics of the JSON while removing unnecessary whitespace.

- I/O workflows
  - Read from files and write to files.
  - Support for streaming or large documents via incremental parsing if needed.

- Memory management workflows
  - Use the built-in allocators or supply custom memory hooks to fit your platformâ€™s memory model.

Usage notes and caveats

- This library targets real-world, resource-constrained environments. It is designed to be predictable and small. In some cases, you may need to tailor memory management to your platform. The library will benefit from a careful integration with your build system.

- If you plan to use JSON Patch or Merge Patch extensively, consider writing a small test harness that exercises edge cases. This helps you identify potential surprises in production.

- When working in a mixed C/C++ codebase, you can include the header in C files or in C++ files. The libraryâ€™s API is designed to be compatible with both languages.

- If you want to enable advanced compiler features, you can define macros to enable or disable certain checks. This gives you control over performance and error reporting.

- If you are integrating into a large codebase, it is prudent to isolate changes in a single header guard to prevent symbol conflicts. The header uses a conventional include guard to minimize collisions.

- When debugging, enable verbose error reporting. The library provides error codes and messages that help you pinpoint issues in parsing, generation, or patching.

- In production, consider using minification and streaming I/O to keep memory usage predictable. Streaming can help handle large documents without loading the entire document into memory at once.

- The UTF-8 validation is strict by default. If you are validating data from trusted sources, you may choose a relaxed path for throughput. However, for safety and interoperability, it's often wise to keep strict validation.

- The libraryâ€™s thread safety is aligned with typical usage. If you plan to share a single document across threads, you should implement your own synchronization or create separate copies per thread.

- Licensing and distribution: This library follows an open approach. You can use it in commercial and non-commercial projects, with attribution as you see fit. The typical distribution model in the STB tradition emphasizes permissive reuse and straightforward integration. If you redistribute the header, consider including a short attribution note and the license terms you are using.

Contributing

- Contributions are welcome. If you want to contribute, follow a simple path:
  - Open an issue to discuss a feature, bug fix, or improvement.
  - Create a small, focused pull request that adds tests and documentation for the change.
  - Keep the code style consistent with the existing header. Embrace the single-header approach.

- Before submitting a significant change, discuss it in an issue. It helps ensure the direction matches the projectâ€™s goals and avoids duplicating work.

- Tests are important. Provide tests that cover your changes. The test suite helps prevent regressions in future commits.

- Documentation updates are valuable. Expand examples and usage notes when you add new capabilities. Clear examples help users adopt the feature quickly.

- The release workflow remains simple: tag a release in the repository, provide notes on changes, and publish assets to the Releases page. This makes it easy for users to pin a version to their project.

Project structure and repository layout

- The core is a single header that contains the implementation and the public API. You can drop this header into any project and start using the API immediately.
- Tests and examples live in separate directories or subdirectories. They provide practical demonstrations and corners of behavior that help ensure the library remains robust.
- Documentation is embedded in the README, with inline code examples and usage patterns. The documentation is designed to be readable, actionable, and easy to follow.

Performance and portability notes

- The library is designed with speed in mind. Parsing is fast for typical JSON documents. Generation is streaming-friendly and efficient for common payloads.
- Memory usage is predictable. The library avoids heavy allocations by default. If you enable custom allocators, you can tune memory behavior to fit your environment.
- In embedded environments, you can strip out optional features that you do not need. For example, you can disable some patching features if your application uses a static data model and a fixed update path.
- Cross-language integration is straightforward. C code can be used in C++ projects with minimal changes, and C++ code can leverage the same header without nonstandard dependencies.

Design tips for users

- Start small. Include the header and write a tiny program to parse a short JSON snippet. Confirm you can access values and re-emit them.
- Add patch usage step by step. Try a patch that adds a field to an object, then a patch that moves a field, and then a patch that removes one.
- Use JSON Pointer to access deep structures. Itâ€™s a simple way to read or update a nested value without writing long loops.
- Try Merge Patch for simple updates. Itâ€™s often the easiest path to update one or two fields without a full patch description.
- Validate UTF-8 as part of your input pipeline. It helps catch data issues early.
- Use minification for network or storage efficiency. It can reduce payload size with no loss of meaning.

Compatibility matrix

- C compatibility: The header supports C and C++ usage. The API adheres to standard C types and idioms so itâ€™s friendly to C programmers.
- C++ compatibility: The header works well in C++ projects. You can wrap calls in a namespace if you want, though the header stays minimal by default.
- Platform compatibility: Desktop platforms and many embedded systems. The header is designed to be portable, with careful attention to common compiler behaviors.

License and distribution notes

- The license is permissive and designed to be friendly for both personal and commercial projects. You can use, modify, and distribute the header. If you redistribute the code as part of a larger project, you should follow the license terms you adopt for your project and include attribution where appropriate.
- If you need a formal license statement for a project, consider MIT or a permissive license compatible with your license policy.
